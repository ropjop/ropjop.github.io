The whole "test experience" can take up to **about 2 hours** (arrival, checks, test, waiting for results), so plan accordingly (also for childcare as if you have kids you cannot bring them into the centre). ([lituktestbooking.co.uk][3]).

If you need special arrangements (disability, language support), declare these when you book and bring supporting evidence on the day. ([lituktestbooking.co.uk][8])

# What happens on the day — step-by-step

1. **Arrive at the test centre**

   * The Home Office will send an arrival time when you book; arrive on time (centres usually ask you to be there ~30 minutes early). If you’re late your test may be cancelled and you may not get a refund. 
   * In my case, I arrived a bit earlier and I was able to take the test before the scheduled time, but some centres might ask you to wait.

2. **Check-in & ID check**

   * At reception you’ll be asked to present the **original** ID you used when booking (passport, BRP, biometric travel document, etc.). The name/details on the ID must match your booking exactly. You will not be allowed to sit the test without the correct ID. ([GOV.UK][2])
   * As part of identity checks, the centre will take a photo of you on the day.
   * You will be subject to a security check (may include a search). Personal items must be left in lockers or a secure area. Centres usually provide lockers. ([lituktestbooking.co.uk][3])
   * If you need go to the bathroom or else, make sure to do this BEFORE the check-in, as you are not allowed to leave and come back once the check-in is completed.

3. **Arrival briefing / instructions**

   * A test centre supervisor will explain rules and confirm any special arrangements you requested (for disability, extra time, etc.). If you made special-needs requests when booking, bring supporting evidence. ([lituktestbooking.co.uk][3])
   * Before starting the test, you will be handed some instructions showing how the buttons in the test interface look like and what they do. Take your time to have a look. There will also be some instructions on screen explaining how the test works.
   * You will start by taking 4 sample questions to get familiar with the test format, these question do not count toward the test result.

4. **Take the test**

   * The test is **computer-based**: 24 multiple-choice questions, **45 minutes** total ([GOV.UK][4]).
   * Some questions require you to select **more than one choice**, so read each question carefully.
   * The wording of the questions is often different than what seen on mock exams found online. For example, if while studying you have encountered the question *"What does the Laurence Olivier Awards recognise?"*, you can expect the same question asked in a different format during the exam:  *"What award recognise excellence in professional theatre?"*.
   * After you submit, you’ll usually receive the result by mail within 10 minutes.

5. **If you pass: you get a unique reference number (URN) / pass notification**

   * If you pass (you must score **75% or more — at least 18/24**), you’ll receive a **unique reference number** or pass notification which you must keep and use in your citizenship/settlement application. ([GOV.UK][2])
   * **IMPORTANT**: don't lose your **URN**, there is no easy way to get it back if you lose it (beside taking the exam again).

6. **If you fail: cooling-off and rebooking rules**

   * If you fail, you’ll be told this on the day. You can retake the test, but you must pay the fee again and normally wait at least **7 days** before rebooking. ([paragonlaw.co.uk][6])
